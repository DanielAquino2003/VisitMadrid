#Project: "Visit Madrid" Website

This project is about creating an informative website focused on the city of Madrid. The site
features sections on news, history, tourist attractions, services, and contact details, all
designed to be both visually appealing and user-friendly.

 **Team Members**:
  ● Daniel Aquino Santiago (xaquind00)
  ● Máximo Martín Moreno (xmartim00)
  
**Code Structure**:
  The project is organized into several HTML and CSS files, ensuring a clean separation
  between content and styling. Each section, such as news, history, and attractions, has its
  own dedicated HTML file, with corresponding CSS styles to ensure easy maintenance and
  clear organization.
